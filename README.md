# search_assesment
working on building a working assesment for information retrival using machine generated data
documentation is still lacking

this code was supposed to be an easy to use repo for this purpose. however as I keep doing reaserch I find that this is not nearly done and so finalizing it is futile. I would make another repo with the user side code for other devlopers once I have a satisfactory algorithem.


# build 
python 3.10

'''bash
pip3 install -r requirments.txt 
'''

'''bash 
createdb -h localhost -U postgres hebrew_search_reaserch
'''

'''bash 
psql -h localhost -U postgres hebrew_search_reaserch < sql_src/setup.sql 
psql -h localhost -U postgres hebrew_search_reaserch < sql_src/question.sql 
'''

## squad

get data that falls into this schenma {'data':list_of_dicts_with(['id', 'title', 'context', 'question', 'answers'])}
got from https://huggingface.co/datasets/tdklab/Hebrew_Squad_v1/blob/main/validation.json

# usage guidelines 
in general the main function of every script is where input varibles should be inserted 
this is to be done manualy for now gona work on fixing it in the future. 

every* main function uses a single transction for the entire operation so closing it prematurly would leave the database in a usble state


## strategies
strategies are an identifier used for every data generation action regardless of table. thier main use is in runing specific expirements on a subset of the data based on generation

strategies should be retrived by name and not passed by Id since Ids are not garnteed to be the same by postgres.

manual intervension with the database is alowed and should not cause major errors. 

renaming stratgies is premited and should be used whenever there was an error in the original excution.


except for translation strategy, the entire database operation can be described by a single strategy Id there is no need to track parents down.
(this may change in the future)

## donts

dont alow 2 strategies to share a name

dont add aproximate indcies to an existing table since that would break old expirements sighlently. 

dont run this in production
